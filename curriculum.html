            <div class="margin-right-5rem">
                <p class="line-height">Children start to learn about the world around them from the moment they are
                    born. The care and
                    education offered by DPS Kidszone Bhopal ensures holistic development of your child with interesting
                    activities that are appropriate for their age and the stage of development.</p>
                <p class="line-height bold margin-top-1rem">Child Centered Learning Approach</p>
                <p class="line-height margin-top-1rem">DPS Kidszone Bhopal provides an environment where children
                    experience the joy of learning, with the
                    excitement of discovery through an integrated and dynamic curriculum. Our curriculum is child
                    centered and teacher guided. We believe in providing experiences that meet the emotional and
                    developmental needs of all children.</p>
                <p class="line-height margin-top-0_5rem">We believe in the teaching methods that enhances Multiple
                    Intelligence of a</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section_bottom">
            <p class="line-height margin-top-2rem">child. To protect learning from boredom and make teaching more effective, the entire syllabus is divided
                theme wise. At DPS Kidszone Bhopal, we strive religiously to keep the curiosity alive in the kids.</p>
            <p class="line-height margin-top-0_5rem">Our assessment and evaluation methods are formative and motivational. We assess children on the basis of
                Comprehensive Constant Evaluation (CCE), which ascertains the holistic development of your child.</p>
            <p class="bold margin-top-1rem">The three prime areas of our curriculum :</p>
            <p class="bold margin-top-1rem">Personal, social and emotional development</p>
            <p class="line-height margin-top-1rem">Children become confident with self-esteem and are able to form good relationships with the peer group as
                well as adults. They learn how to work independently and as a part of a group with their experience in
                being able to concentrate and persevere in their learning and to seek help where needed. They are eager
                to become knowledge explorers and show ability to initiate new ideas and to solve simple practical
                problems. They demonstrate independence in dressing, personal hygiene and selecting an activity or
                resources. They express their feelings and behave in appropriate ways with an understanding of what is
                right, what is wrong and why. They develop respect for cultural beliefs of their own and also of others.
            </p>
            <p class="bold margin-top-1rem">Physical Development</p>
            <p class="line-height margin-top-1rem">Children move confidently and imaginatively with increasing control and co-ordination. They use a range
                of small and large balancing and climbing equipments to remain fit. Kids also learn to safely handle
                appropriate tools, objects, construction and malleable materials with increasing control. Children are
                made aware of healthy living and are able to independently manage self-care.</p>
            <p class="bold margin-top-1rem">Communication and Language</p>
            <p class="line-height margin-top-1rem">In small groups children listen attentively and talk about their experiences. They pay attention and are
                able to communicate with other children and adults. Kids develop a rich vocabulary and also learn to
                speak fluent English. They listen and respond to stories, songs, nursery rhymes and poems. Children
                enjoy books from our well stocked book corner and handle them carefully.</p>
            <p class="line-height margin-top-0_5rem">The perfect blend of academics and co-scholastic activities like dance, music, Shakespeare club, PE
                class, yoga and aerobics makes DPS Kidszone Bhopal a unique learning destination.</p>
            <p class="line-height margin-top-0_5rem">With a special emphasis on development of intra personal and communication skills, Circle time activities
                are planned for children. Many competitions, field trips and nature walks are planned across a year for
                children to foster their development in different domains and also to develop a sense of accomplishment.
